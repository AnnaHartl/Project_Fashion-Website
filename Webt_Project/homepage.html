				Psychology of fashion is the study of the impact of clothing in which way we perceive and judge others.

				On our website we talk a lot about fashion, in this article I want to explain how to find your style.
				Knowing what looks good on you and in what clothes you feel empowered is so beneficial to your life and even if you already know your style maybe you can still learn something.
				This article has a personal agenda, because I don’t have a style or at least I do not think I have one.
				Let’s go together on this journey!

				Second-Hand-Fashion is not a bad thing and just because you don't wear the newest fashion does not mean you're not cool or good enough.
                The good things about Second-Hand-Fashion are that it is more environmental-friendlier than the other clothings and it is also much cheaper than the original clothing.

				These wardrobe essentials are the best way to building your own wardrobe and style.
				The point of having this certain things is that they can be easily combined with the new things you get to develop your style.
				It is also better for the environment, because you will end up in the long term buying less unesserary clothes.
