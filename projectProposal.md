# Fashion Website
## Overview
The goal is to entertain the people that come to our website, we want it to be an easy way to learn about fashion. People underestimate how enormous fashion is affecting our life and culture. We want to bring light to different aspect of fashion. Our website should be different than the usual fashion websites.

## Rough Timeline
* Start: September 2019
* Halftime: February 2020 
  Finished: website front-end structure
  Grad: 2 (improving is still in progress)
* End: 16th of June

## Goal
Goal is to have a website that is aesthetically pleasing and is functional/ interactive with the user. Trying to insert as many pictures as possible users should know what`s up by looking at our website even for 1 Minute when they have little to no time.

## Specification
The motivation behind our project is that we want to show everyone fashion is not just for girls, it is not all pink and sparkly, that’s why we want to keep our website well balanced in color and content. It is professional, we try to entertain people not woman/girls. Everyone that comes to our website should feel welcome, guys especially should not feel intimidated. Our goal is to have an interesting topic for everyone (every age class, gender and so on).

Our target audience are women and men in their teenage years and 20’s we want to appeal to a young audience, because we understand their problems best.

Tamara and I will make our plans and exchange our ideas every Tuesday in the morning, we will also update each other on our progress. Most of the work will be done at home and separately. It is more efficient that way. 
When we have a rough structure of how our website should look like and what interactive elements we are going to have, we will make small goals to achieving exactly what we want.

Our goal is to have a full functional website at the end of June, I think it is the best date because we would still have 3 weeks till summer break and that gives us time to improve our website with the criticism of our teachers and we do not have tests two weeks before.

We intend on having no cost, because we don’t want to publish our website yet, so no server costs.

## Project Approach
We are going to use different tools to make our website. To develop our website we use html, CSS for aesthetic purposes and JavaScript for the interactive elements. We use a json server to store data. To exchange us we use WhatsApp, we still have to work on that, because the changes are not automatically synced so little details can be lost, maybe GitHub is a better solution.## Task 

## Breakdowns and Time Estimates
* Rework and improve the website status last grading (End of April)
* Getting a detailed plan on what we want to add, information and interactive elements (5th of May)
* Dividing up the tasks (5th of May)
*	Starting programming and developing the website till 16th of June

## Risk Management
* Aesthetically not pleasing website
  To prevent this, I want to make an inspirational collage where we include picture and a color palette so we both know what    colors to use.

*	Handling disputes
  Working with someone is sometimes difficult, we will have disagreements none the less I want them to be handled and discussed professionally, preferably face to face else per phone.

*	Finishing on time
  To guarantee that, we are making to-do list and breaking down our goals.
  
## Conclusion
I’m excited to be working on such a big project. It is the biggest project we’ve ever made. Last year we already made a project, but it was for just four weeks it is different to stay on a project for a whole year.  It is a great opportunity to learn how to plan and structure bigger projects such as this. I think it will help us tremendously in the future. I hope we are achieving our goals and at the end gaining even more passion for building websites.
